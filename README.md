# GraphGen
Simple mathematical graphing calculator inspired by Desmos, made with SFML and C++.

Made by altering functions based on variables, a, n, and c, and therefore can only support polynomials.

Made as a personal project to advance my knowledge and learn new skills.

How to run:

->Go to "Releases" on the right hand side and click the latest version.

->Download GraphGen.zip

->Extract and run the exe file!

How to modify:

->Create a new empty sfml project and link with editor (There are tutorials on youtube on how to do this with visual studio)

->Take all the files in the GraphGen folder and put them in the directory of cpp and h files (Should be name of project)

->Build!
