# GraphGen
Simple mathematical graphing calculator inspired by Desmos, made with SFML and C++.

Made by altering functions based on variables, a, n, and c, and therefore can only support _polynomials._

## Installation:

- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/NicholasEgerton/GraphGen/releases) and select the latest version.

- Download GraphGen.zip

- Extract and run the exe file!

## Dependencies to modify:

- C++ Compiler
- SFML

## How to modify:

- Create a new empty sfml project and link with editor (There are tutorials on this such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFzpkvrscs4&t=110s&pp=ygUXc2ZtbCB2aXN1YWwgc3R1ZGlvIDIwMjI%3D)).

- Take all the .cpp and .h files and place them in the same directory as the source.cpp file of your project.

- Build!

- Then, take the fonts and images from their folders and drag them into the debug and release folders.
