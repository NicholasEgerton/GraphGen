# GraphGen
Simple mathematical graphing calculator inspired by Desmos, made with SFML and C++.

Made by altering functions based on variables, a, n, and c, and therefore can only support polynomials.

Made as a personal project to advance my knowledge and learn new skills.

How to run:

->Go to "Releases" on the right hand side and click the latest version.

->Download GraphGen.zip

->Extract and run the exe file!

Dependencies to modify:

->C++ Compiler
->SFML

How to modify:

->Create a new empty sfml project and link with editor (There are tutorials on youtube on how to do this with visual studio)

->Take all the .cpp and .h files and place them in the same directory as the source.cpp file of your project.

->Build!

->Then, take the fonts and images from their folders and drag them into the debug and release folders.

->Run!
