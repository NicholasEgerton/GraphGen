# GraphGen
Simple mathematical graphing calculator inspired by Desmos, made with SFML and C++.

Made by altering a graph based on variables, a, n, and c, and therefore can only support functions of the form:

ax^n + c

Made as a personal project to advance my knowledge and learn new skills.

How to run:

->Download/Clone

->Navigate to GraphGen/Debug or GraphGen/Release (Debug will have command prompt as debug log)

Requirements to modify:

->SFML

How to modify:

->Create a new empty sfml project and link with editor (There are tutorials on youtube on how to do this with visual studio)

->Take all the files in the GraphGen folder and put them in the directory of cpp and h files (Should be name of project)

->Build!
